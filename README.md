### Introduction:
This is an example of the structural design pattern called "Bridge" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example simulates a case when some [equipment](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Bridge/tree/master/src/main/java/org/example/equipment "equipment") with features, is being controlled by a player (in this case [Link](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Bridge/tree/master/src/main/java/org/example/player "Link")) and how those actions affect the condition of the equipment.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Bridge/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/Bridge/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
